History: When I was younger, I used to wake up to the crows of roosters, to the songs of the chirping swallows, to the mooing of cows asking to be fed. for eight years of my life, I lived in the coolest farm ever in a house made completely of cement. It was the only life I knew until I moved to the city. Adjusting to living in Chicago was an exciting yet challenging process. The busy city was a complete 180 difference from my life in Mexico. Learning the language and culture took time, but I appreciate where I am. If someone were to go back in time and tell a seven year old me that I would be in college in the United States, the little me would be in disbelief. I am proud of my accomplishments and how far I have come, however, and I am excited to use my privilege of being here to continue growing.

Education: I completed all my higher education in Chicago, IL. I attended Marie Sklodowska Curie Metropolitan High School in Brighton Park. I was part of the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme, which allowed me to graduate with a weighed GPA of 5.22. One of my greatest accomplishments was graduating as Valedictorian of my high school class. Considering that I came from foreign background, I challenged myself and overachieved. Another great accomplishment from high school was becoming the Team Captain of the school's Academic Decathlon Team. As part of the competition, I always finished with the awards for Highest Team and Division Scorer at City Championship and Regional competitions. I also participated in the city's Science Fair. For my participation and research, I was awarded Gold recognition for the Science Fair Symposium portion at the State Science Fair (IJAS) and city competition.
