History: When I was younger, I used to wake up to the crows of roosters, to the songs of the chirping swallows, to the mooing of cows asking to be fed. for eight years of my life, I lived in the coolest farm ever in a house made completely of cement. It was the only life I knew until I moved to the city. Adjusting to living in Chicago was an exciting yet challenging process. The busy city was a complete 180 difference from my life in Mexico. Learning the language and culture took time, but I appreciate where I am. If someone were to go back in time and tell a seven year old me that I would be in college in the United States, the little me would be in disbelief. I am proud of my accomplishments and how far I have come, however, and I am excited to use my privilege of being here to continue growing.
